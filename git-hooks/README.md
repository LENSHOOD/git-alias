## My Git Hooks
In this directory, I've shared some of my own hooks, which is running in my projects.
All of them are code by my self, and please feel free to use it everywhere you like.

### Hook for Conventional Commit Message
See file: `commit-msg`

This is a commit message hook, it will check the commit message after run `git commit -m 'xxx'` or run `git commit` and save at editor.

The check style is Conventional Commits, which is a set of rule of commit message format, [click here to get more information.](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

I wrote some shell check code that follow Conventional Commits rule.
